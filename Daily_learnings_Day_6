Companies that have used DevOps

Amazon: Moved their physical server footprint to Amazon Web Services in 2010 and in 2011 adopted a continued deployment process where developers could deploy code whenever they want to and to whatever servers they needed. 

Netflix: Carries out CI/CD and Continuous monitoring is in place so if the deployment of the images fail, the new images are rolled back and traffic is rerouted to the previous version. 

Etsy: They especially noticed it was needed when they realised that developers felt responsible for deployment, application performance, uptime and other goals.

HOW NETFLIX THINKS OF DEVOPS
- Learn the balance between freedom and responsiblity i.e do not wait for tasks to be assigned to me, pick them up and do them
- Do not be another cog in the wheel, challenge systems and ways of doing things.
- Do not do a lot of guesses, gut instinct or working based on traditions. 
- Everything Netflix does is driven by data


DEVOPS: THE AMAZON STORY
- In order to move to devops, an organization has to break down their software into small microservices instead of one big monolisthic app.
- Microservices are services that have only one role and work on their own. They are cloud native architectural applications in which a single application is composed of many loosely coupled and independently deployable smaller components, or services

ETSY
- They created a designated ops role which meat that person had to be present in all other departments and do a cross-team collaboration and communication on a more frequent basis.
- The tech stack they chose was LAMP: Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP
