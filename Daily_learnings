- DevOps is a continous process, it is not a software but rather a skillset and a couple of tools. 
- The tools I will have to learn on this path include but are not limited to: Command line, Basic Networking, Cloud, Virtualization and containers, Kubernetes,
  - CI/CD, Infrastructure as code, Observability, Policy, Service Mesh. 
- I can become anything I want to become. I just have to take the first and hardest step which is to start.
