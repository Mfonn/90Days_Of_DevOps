- There are two parts of an application. The development part where the software developers work on the code and the operations part where it is
  - deployed to a server. DevOps is a link between the two.
- DevOps should be involved in the development lifecycle moving from Idea -> code -> Build -> Deploy -> Manage -> learn 
 - Then taking whatever is learnt back to the beginning to be incorporated in the lifecycle. 
  
 -Modern applications should be delivered by modern teams on modern platforms and should be about the people, process and tools and improve business agility. 
 - Benefits of DevOps include Speed, Rapid Delivery, Reliability, Scale, Improved Collaboration and Security.
 - DevOps culture should be incorporated in companies using DevOps teams. The DevOps culture implies that the operations team and the development teams
  - do not work in silos. Rather they work together. Deployment is done in small frequent incremental changes in order to reduce the risks inorder to deliver 
  - rapidly in safe and reliable manner.
 - DevOps best practices include: Continous integration, Continous Delivery, Monitoring and logging, MicroServices, Communication and Collaboration, 
  - Infrastructure as code.
  
- What is Infrastructure as Code: This is when Infrastructure is provided and managed using code and software development techniques such as version control
  - and continous integration. For infrastructure provisioning, Terraform is advised, And Ansible for Configuration Management.
  
 - DevOps vs SRE: Site Reliability Engineering is implementing DevOps principles but with more emphasis on reliability and keeping systems stable.
