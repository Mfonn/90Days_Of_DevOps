- Agile and DevOps practices are similar as they are both about delivering changes in small incremental amounts. Their differences lie in the teams they are involved with. 
- Agile focuses on optimising communication betweeen end-users and developers while DevOps targets operations and Developers. Agile is more outward looking involving project managers and developers while DevOps is a set of internal practices involving developers, QA, operataions.
- Agile frameworks are tools that allow for communication and transparency such as kaban, lean, scrum, extreme, crystal, dynamic, feature-driven while DevOps promotes practices such as infrastructure as code, architecture as code, monitoring, self-healing, end-to-end automation. 
In Agile, the main source of feedback is the end-users while in DevOps the stakeholders and the team have a higher priority.
Agile allows coming back to previous product development stages to fix errors and prevent the accumulation of technical debt. 
To adopt agile and DevOps simultaneously, 7 steps have to be followed:
    1) Unite the development and operations teams
    2) Create build anr run teams, all development and operational concerns are discussed by the entire DevOps team
    3) Change approach to sprints and assign priority ratings to offer DevOps tasks that have the same value as development tasks
    4) Include QA in all development stages
    5) Choose right tools
    6) Automate everything I can 
    7) Measure and control by using tangible numeric deliverables.


DAY IN THE LIFE OF A DEVOPS ENGINEER 2021
- Start by looking through work messages to check for anything that happened during the night that is urgent that I could've missed out on.
- Kubernetes, Ansible? Secrets stored using Ansible Vault? Docker again? Moving from Docker compose services to Kubernetes Services?
- Try to workout frequently
- Dress up for work, changes my mental state.
- AWS RDS for Databases? to save database costs?
- Kubernetes cluster? CUBE? 
- Keep learning to keep my skills upto date and keep up with technology as it changes. 
- CI/CD? A lot of time is used on it for setting up but after that, not so much time is spent on it for updates.

3 THINGS A DEVOPS ENGINEER SHOULD KNOW
- Avoid being too biased about certain technologies or tech stack. 
- Learn and undertstand the fundamentals helps to be able to learn new technologies faster.
- Keep it Simple
- Use open source in my side projects in other to learn more technologies


HOW TO BECOME A DEVOPS ENGINEER
- P.S Ansible is an open source software that automates software provisioning configuration management and application deployment. Ansible connects via SSH, remote PowerShell or via other remote APIs. 
- DevOps work makes everyone's work easier and automated. 
- Don't use DevOps to do what I can not do manually, I have to know what's happening underneath.
- Linux administration -> Systems administration -> Find a way to solve a problem I have using DevOps, a work I am tired of doing on my own.  
- Ansible uses SSH, headless? Embed Systems?
