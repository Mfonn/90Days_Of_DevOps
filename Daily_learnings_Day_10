`go run`: This command compiles and runs the main package comprised of the .go files specified on the command line. The command is compiled to a temporary folder. 
`go build`: To compile packages and dependencies, compile the package in the current directory if it is the main package if not it will place the executable in the pkg folder. 
  `go build` also enables building an executable file for any Go Supported OS platform.
`go install`: The same as go build but will place the executable in the bin folder.

GOLANG WITH NANA
- Go compiles errors to enforce better code quality. 
- Variable names must be used to avoid possibly dead code, i.e it is never used in the code. 
- Imported packages must also be used in the code.
- Syntax for using a variable in a statement p.s the space automatically gets added before and after the variable.
    `fmt.Println("Welcome to", variableName, "booking application"
    
 - `Printf` prints formatted data. It has a placeholder that tells the fmt functions how to format the variable passed in. 
 - The syntax us 
    `fmt.printf("Some text with a variable %v, second variable %v", myVariable, anotherVariable)`
    
 - Go is a statically typed language. i.e Go Compiler needs to be told the data type when declaring the variable especially when a variable is defined without the value being defined. So it can anticipate the data type. 
    e.g var userName string

- Multiple variables can be declared at the same time using:
var (
  actorName string = "Elisabeth Sladen"
  companion string = "Sarach Jane Smith"
  doctorNumber int = 3
  season int = 11
)

- the package "bufio" takes input from the user
- other packages that will be used include: "os", "strconv", "strings"
- A lot of other things I do not understand but will hopefully understand as I go on.
